i was a bit bored and was thinking on how i can make my coding expirience easier and faster.  
So i created a custom cli which creates me folder structures based on some templates

```bash
  npm i cpr-bnm@latest -g
```

  npx create
```


## Currently supported layouts

- Vite template

- Basic HTML/CSS/JS setup
- hopefully more in the future...
